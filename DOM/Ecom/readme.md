Here, i have created a E-Commerce website.
here i have used only HTML & JavaScript. No CSS is used.
in this project, user can create account and log in.
then user can add products in cart and if user adds product which is alredy in cart, website will show an alert about it.
in cart page, user can update, increase and decrease quantity of product. when product quantity is less than 1, product will be automatically removed from cart.
user can also remove product by using remove button.
total price will be automatically calculated and will be shown down there.
all this data is stored in localstorage, so that whenever user log into website, user's cart data will be automatically updated.

Here is Video Demonstration :
